# Neural Chess Bot in Rust

This repository hosts a state-of-the-art neural chess bot developed in Rust, combining transformer-based models with cutting-edge machine learning techniques. It's trained on Chess960 games, starting from scratch, marking a significant advancement in chess AI research. Our approach uses self-supervised learning (SSL) strategies, similar to those in vision tasks, to understand chess intricacies.

## Overview

Our goal is to develop not just a chess AI but a digital grandmaster capable of creating masterpiece games. Through policy distillation, we refine our bot to mimic the styles of human grandmasters, delivering an unmatched chess experience.

## Unique Features

- **Transformer Models**: Utilizes Chess960 games for training, achieving a comprehensive understanding of chess dynamics.
- **Advanced SSL**: Leads in applying self-supervised learning to chess, focusing on optimal board encoding and state-of-the-art techniques.
- **Rust Infrastructure**: Employs Rust for rapid simulation and processing, ensuring efficiency.
- **Multi-Language Integration**: Combines Python and potentially Go for a versatile toolkit encompassing machine learning, data handling, and visualization.
- **Interactive Frontend**: Offers an interface for playing against the bot, simulating games, and accessing strategic analysis tools.
- **Grandmaster Emulation**: Applies policy distillation to replicate grandmaster-level strategies and decisions.
- **Cheat Detection**: Conducts research to identify and counteract cheating, promoting fair play.
- **Vector Database and Embeddings**: Facilitates advanced strategic insights through chess position embeddings and similarity searches.

## Key Components

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Utilizes MCTS, enhanced with AI insights, for effective game tree navigation.
- **Neural Networks**: Leverages PyTorch to boost the bot's evaluative and strategic capabilities.
- **Self-Play Mechanism**: Engages in continuous self-play, refining the neural network policy for optimal performance.
- **Tournament Simulations**: Tests the bot against leading AI in simulated tournaments to evaluate its skill and style.

## Future Directions

Our quest to advance AI chess continues. We're exploring new techniques, integrating extensive chess resources, and refining our AI to compete in top tournaments like the TCEC and to redefine artificial chess intelligence.

We invite contributions, questions, and collaborations from chess enthusiasts, AI researchers, and the curious. Join us in shaping the future of chess AI.
