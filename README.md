# Neural Chess Bot in Rust

This repository is home to a cutting-edge neural chess bot implemented in Rust, showcasing a unique fusion of transformer-based models and advanced machine learning techniques. Trained entirely on Chess960 games starting from scratch, this bot represents a pioneering step into research-driven chess AI, leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies reminiscent of those in vision tasks to comprehend the intricacies of chess.
## Overview

Our ambition stretches beyond creating a mere chess-playing AI; we aim to sculpt a digital grandmaster capable of crafting masterpiece games. By employing policy distillation, we meticulously refine our bot to emulate the nuanced styles of human grandmasters, offering an unparalleled chess-playing experience.
## Unique Features

    Transformer Models: Trained on Chess960 style games from zero experience, ensuring a broad and deep understanding of chess dynamics.
    Advanced SSL: Pioneering research into self-supervised learning for chess, focusing on optimal board encoding and state-of-the-art AI techniques.
    Rust Infrastructure: Leveraging Rust's performance for fast simulation and processing, ensuring a seamless and efficient backend.
    Multi-Language Integration: Utilizing Python and potentially Go for machine learning, data manipulation, and visualization, creating a versatile and powerful toolset.
    Interactive Frontend: A fully-functional interface for playing against the bot, simulating bot-vs-bot games, and accessing in-depth analysis tools for strategic preparation and style alignment.
    Grandmaster Emulation: Using policy distillation to simulate human-like grandmaster strategies and decision-making processes.
    Cheat Detection: Ongoing research into identifying and mitigating cheating, ensuring fair and genuine gameplay.
    Vector Database and Embeddings: Advanced visualization and similarity searches powered by chess position embeddings, enabling deep strategic insights.

## Key Components

    Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): At the core of our decision-making, MCTS is refined with AI insights to navigate the game tree effectively.
    Neural Networks: Employing PyTorch for neural guidance, enhancing the bot's evaluative capabilities and strategic depth.
    Self-Play Mechanism: Continual self-improvement through autonomous gameplay, honing the neural network policy for peak performance.
    Tournament Simulations: Post-training, the bot is pitted against top-tier AI in simulated tournaments to assess its prowess and stylistic fidelity.

## Future Directions

The journey doesn't end here; we're on a relentless quest to transcend current AI chess paradigms. We're exploring novel techniques, integrating comprehensive chess resources, and refining our AI to not only compete in prestigious tournaments like the TCEC but also to redefine what's possible in the realm of artificial chess intelligence.
